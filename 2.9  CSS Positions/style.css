/* 1.static
    
     * position:static; its always positioned normal flow of
         the page.
     * HTML elements are positioned static by default.
     * Static positioned elements are not affected by 
         the top, bottom, left, and right properties.    
  */

/* 2. Relative

      * Position:relative; its working normal flow.
      * using relative positioned to adjust top,right,left,bottom away from normal position.
      * Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
*/

/* 3. Absolute

      * position:Absolute; its using the documents body and moves along
        with page scrolling.
      * Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements.
 */

/* 4. fixed
 
       * position:fixed; its always stays in the same place,even if the page is scrolled.
       * the top,rigth,left,bottom are used to position the element
 */
/* 5. Sticky
  
       * position:sticky; is based on the user's enter the values to scroll the page.
       * A sticky is work between Relative and fixed scroll position.
       * Internet Explorer does not support sticky positioning.
       Safari requires a -webkit- prefix 
     (see example below).
       * You must also specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.
